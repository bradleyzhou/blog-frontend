    <h1>About me and this site</h1>
    <p>I am Bradley and this is my personal blog. Every now and then I would write about my learnings and thoughts on software development. Welcome :D</p>
    <p>I was a neuroscientist by training, and I am now transitioning to software development. I had a great time in asking questions and solving problems during my PhD research on learning and memory and neuro-circuitry of fruit flys (and yes puny fruit flys can learning things and have brains in their heads). But I have always been enthusiastic in computers and programming, whether it be setting up a linux-based file-sharing server or writing software for data analysis. It is always a pleasure when you (finally) make computers do what you told them.</p>
    <p>I hope you find my site useful, or at least interesting. You can find me at <a href="https://github.com/bradleyzhou">GitHub</a>, or drop me a line to bradley at bradleyzhou.com.</p>
